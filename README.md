## Why this exists

There are thousands of Pakistani students trying to break into data science. Most of them don't know where to start, can't afford paid courses, and have no one to guide them.

There was no single place on the internet that had everything in one spot — free courses in Urdu and English, Pakistani datasets, local communities, job boards, roadmaps.

**This is that place. And it's built by us, for us.**
